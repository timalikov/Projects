# The Connect 4 game
The Connect 4 game is a classic two-player strategy game that challenges players to connect four of their colored discs vertically, horizontally, or diagonally before their opponent does. The game is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and features a grid-based game board, user interface elements such as buttons and scoreboards, and game logic that handles player moves and win conditions.
The game demonstrates several key programming concepts, such as event handling, data structures, conditional logic, and user interface design. The game is a good demonstration of the ability to work with front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
